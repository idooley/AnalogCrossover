This repo contains some python code to help in selecting optimal capacitor and resistor values for a Sallen-Key topology active filter. Also some DipTrace schematics, PCB layouts, and gerbers are included (both for the crossover circuit PCB and a corresponding dual-rail power supply).

The design is based off a design contained in Douglas Self's excellent book "The Design of Active Crossovers".
