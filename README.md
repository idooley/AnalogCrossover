## Overview
This repo contains some python code to help in selecting optimal capacitor and resistor values for a Sallen-Key topology active filter. Also some DipTrace schematics, PCB layouts, and gerbers are included (both for the crossover circuit PCB and a corresponding dual-rail power supply).

## Background
The design is based off a design contained in Douglas Self's excellent book "The Design of Active Crossovers".

## Isaac's DIY Project

The nearly final product of this DIY product consists of these two working crossover/delay boards and their power supply:

Now I just need to put these in an enclosure of some kind (and add those two missing fuses you may have noticed in the picture). After doing this I'll measure the frequency response and noise floor more carefully.
